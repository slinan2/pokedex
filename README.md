#Pokedex
## Prerequisites

1. `Java 11` must be installed.

### Running locally
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/slinan2/pokedex
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:test
```
### Extras
- Instead of a cache layer, a full JPA integration was coded. By default, an "in memory DB" (H2) runs in the development environment.
